# Cognitive Guardian

Cognitive Guardian is an agentic AI system designed to challenge
high-risk human decisions before irreversible harm occurs.

Instead of optimizing for convenience, the system prioritizes:
- Risk awareness
- Long-term consequence simulation
- Cognitive bias detection
- Ethical refusal of harmful actions

The system does not replace human choice.
It slows down harmful decisions.
